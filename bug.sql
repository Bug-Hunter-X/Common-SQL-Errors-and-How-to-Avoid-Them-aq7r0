In SQL, a common error is using the wrong data type for a column. For example, if you are storing dates, using a VARCHAR instead of a DATE data type can lead to issues with sorting, searching, and data integrity.  Another error is incorrectly handling NULL values.  Failing to account for NULLs in joins or WHERE clauses can lead to unexpected results or errors.  Incorrectly using aggregate functions without a GROUP BY clause can also produce unexpected results.  Finally, SQL injection vulnerabilities can be introduced by directly embedding user inputs into SQL queries without proper sanitization.
